## Architecture
### Layered
* Complex programs can be best partitioned into layers
* A design within each layer that is cohesive and depends only on layers below.
* Concentrate all the code related to the domain model in one layer
* Isolate domain from UI, application, and infrastructure

### Presentation layer
